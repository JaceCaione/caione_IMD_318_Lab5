            <h1>Early Origins</h1>
            <p>Originating in Ancient Greece as a form of flat cakes called 'Obelios', early forms of waffles spread throughout medieval Europe. Some of the earliest western european examples are that of Communion Wafers, which were often baked between iron pans depicting some scene of religious significance. As opposed to modern waffles, these wafers were often only composed of flour and water, which was in line with the lack of ingredients present for many people living at the time.</p>

            <h1>Late Medieval to Renaissance</h1>
            <p>Some of the earliest recipes of a true waffle were written by a french man as instructions to his wife; this source details 4 recipes, 3 of them are variations of the first. The waffle quickly became a high-class pastry, with professional waffle makers becoming a genuine trade. By the 17th century the variations available to the public were often either unsweetened or utilized honey-based sweeteners; however, for the monarchy and the rich, sugar sweetened and wheat based waffles were easily available.</p>

            <h1>Early Modern to Contemporary</h1>
            <p>Skipping over even more change, by the early 20th century the aforementioned "professional waffle makers" had become increasingly rare, with only 29 being in Paris. The waffle had became a predominantly homemade product around the first half of the 20th century; things like electric waffle makers made eating the scrumptious pastry even more easy. As it stands today, many of the original recipes for waffles have become increasingly unused, though 18th century recipes are still ocassionally utilized.</p>
